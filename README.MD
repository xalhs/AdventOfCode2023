# Advent of Code 2023
These are my scripts for the puzzles at https://adventofcode.com/2023 I will be uploading all days that I solve with a short commentary on thought process/description. All the puzzles (so far) have been solved without looking up any hint related to the event. Note that my naming process for the input texts is input + the date. So for the first day it was input1.txt, the second day input2.txt... etc.

## Day 15
Day 15 was pretty easy, the first part is just applying some hash algorithm. The second part was confusing to read but it's pretty clear from the description that we are supposed to use dictionaries which make the puzzle pretty easy.
